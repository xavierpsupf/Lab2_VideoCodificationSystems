My name is Xavier PeÃ±a Salat and my NIA is 240456. In this GitHub repository I have upload the Lab 2 of the Video Codification Systems subject of Pompeu Fabra University.

This laboratory has been done with python trough PyCharm. In order to execute correctly the code of that lab, at least it's necessary to have configured correctly PyCharm and, also, it's important to have installed the following extra Python Packages: -> ffmpeg -> numpy -> scipy

Important! Due to its big weight, I cannot upload to GitHub the following videos:

- BigBuckBunny_mp4_video.mp4
- BigBuckBunny_mpeg_video.mpeg
- output_video_changed_subsampling.mp4
